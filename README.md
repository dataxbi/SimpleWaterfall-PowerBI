# Simple Waterfall
Simple Waterfall, as name suggest allows users to create a multi step waterfall chart with full control to defind how measures are used and how they are layed out in the waterfall. User can define which measures are "Base / Pillers" and which measures are "Step measures". You can move them around to get them arrange in the right order without the need to create any custom sort order. 

Version 2.0 has significant improvements compared to version 1. We have added new ways of creating waterfall and a lot of formatting options are now available.

## DRILLABLE WATERFALL
Create a drillable waterfall with multiple measures and multiple categories. In this chart, your measures are used as the pillars and the data points are used to calculate the difference between each measure to define the steps

## SINGLE CATEGORY WATERFALL
Create a waterfall by using one measure and one category. You will be able to define the pillars based on the data points. If you donâ€™t define any pillar, each data point is used as a step, showing the total of all the categories at the end. This is also the default behaviour until you define the pillars

## STATIC WATERFALL
Create a waterfall by using measures only. The visual will allow you to define which of the measures are pillars measures and which are step measures

## NEW FORMATTING OPTIONS
-	Define bar colours, label font colours and label positioning based on sentiment (i.e. favourable or adverse) or individually customise each bar.
-	Choose which measure or category is a pillar and which is a step (except in case of drillable waterfall) directly within the visual
-	All standard customisation for X-axis and Y-axis available

## NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-	Report page tooltip added
-	Drillthrough option added
-	Right click (context menu ) added
